- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lesego-creator
- 🚀 Mechatronics | AI Enthusiast | Software Developer in the Making
I'm a fourth-year Mechatronics Engineering student with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. I love blending hardware and software to solve real-world problems and build cool projects.

🔭 What I'm Working On:
Exploring the intersection of mechatronics and AI, focusing on robotics, automation, and machine learning.
Learning and experimenting with microcontrollers like STM32 and embedded systems.
Building projects that combine my interests in mechanical systems, electronics, and software.

🌱 Currently Learning:
Advanced C/C++ and MATLAB programming for embedded systems.
Enhancing my software architecture and development skills.

💡 Completed university level projects:
Smart Prepaid Energy Controller Design
Automated Reversing for a Vehicle with a Trailer - Final year project
Machine learning algorithms
Control systems

🤖 Fun Fact:
I enjoy tinkering with hardware just as much as coding! From building simulation models to developing software architectures, I'm always up for a new challenge.
